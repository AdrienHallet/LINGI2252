- First scenario: the anti-burglar is set in the ground floor or in the entire house? Because the baby is inside the house. :p

Feature diagram appreciation: 0/+
---------------

- Layout: could be better -> too small.
+ OO approach
- Ambiance must be rename
- Phone notification must be a feature of the root
- Spatial, Video, Security, Rooms should be have a clause 'OR' with these children to have a more realistic world.
- Some constraints are missing => e.g. poolcleaner => swimming pool
