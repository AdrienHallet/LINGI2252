# Benoit's remarks after the second meeting (20/11/2018)
## Feature model
- Put *or* relationship on most branches

## Design patterns
- *Observer* pattern?
- `HomeController` shouldn't be `static` to implement the *Facade* pattern
- `HomeController` could be a *Singleton*
- The factories implement the *Factory* pattern and not the *Abstract factory*
- The parametrization component could implement the *Interpreter* pattern?
