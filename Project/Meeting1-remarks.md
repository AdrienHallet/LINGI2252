# Benoit's remarks after the first meeting (22/10/2018)
## Feature model
- Add constraints between rooms and features (e.g. `pool cleaner => swimming pool`.
- Rename `Ambiance` into something more meaningful.
- Most arcs should be OR and not AND.
- I think there was something more but I don't remember what.

## Class diagram
- Exemplify the `Scenario`, `Actuator` and `ConnectedDevice` classes (with one subclass for each). Add a note to say that those are examples.
